heading west is sitting in a hammock for so long the aspen trunks change from white to pale cream to a subdues tan painted over a base of green as the sun jogs across the sky

heading west is	“are you going to bed?”  
&nbsp; “well it’s dark out”  
and  
&nbsp; “we’re awake so early”  
&nbsp; “well the sun is up”  

heading west is  
&nbsp; shorts  
&nbsp; pants on  
&nbsp; sweater on  
&nbsp; sweater off  
&nbsp; sweater on  
&nbsp; socks on  
&nbsp; back to barefoot

&nbsp; sweater off  
&nbsp; sweater on  
&nbsp; pants on  
&nbsp; socks on  
&nbsp; boots on  
&nbsp; raincoat on
