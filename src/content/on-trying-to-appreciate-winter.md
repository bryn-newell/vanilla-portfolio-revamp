<h2 class="leMurmure center">I</h2>

today I realized not everything is brown.  
if you look  
not glance  
the foothills are sage  
just the kind that’s still being kept a secret

"everything is dead,  
it’s nothing but a sheet of grey"  
but that’s not strictly true is it?  
the scrub brush is whispering about the undertones of moss  
and their cerulean veins are waiting to be scratched free  
of its warm, dusty bark

<!-- to do - is pine right??? -->
one of the best parts about living in colorado is that pine trees never lose their leaves  
those evergreen forests holding their name sake and keeping us company through the cold months  
but the day after it snows when the sky clears  
and before the sun comes back to melt it all off  
the tiny little alpine needles become illustrious  
a color that doesn’t exist on its own,  
tiny little drops of magic winking in the light  
the combination of elements  
alchemy

snow on the flatirons is a different kind of gift  
it shifts our far fetched auburn vistas into a different climate  
we somehow leave the high desert and travel into a wonderland  
perhaps one where yule festivals are held year round  
where the tinkling of bells and 12 point stags trapse through the woods  
suddenly we have that life giving moisture  
ready to melt its way into our streams and springs as the sun warms it away.  
the way the landscape reaches for new paints, a new palette  
matching the temperature of the sky  
refreshes me  
makes it feel like this place is new.  
and being somewhere new means i’m not taking it for granted again  
i can stay  
just a little longer
