In tandem with Vail’s data and infrastructure, we introduced a new and innovative way for skiers to interact with over 30+ ski resorts and manage their Epic pass. My primary focus was on developing the SVG map, including custom styling and animated interactions, as well the development of trails and lifts pages and data, and ensuring clean user experience throughout.",

    "description": "A new website for Vidanta World Resorts in Mexico. I was a part of the core development team that initially built out all of the content models through Contentstack and built out the components this custom data would be piped into. These models were mapped to reusable pages so content managers could change the copy, images, and order of components with complete freedom, while keeping the integrity of the designs across the site.",

Leveraging Contentstack, we developed a suite of reusable page templates and content models and using GraphQL we automated the creation of dynamic pages. This allowed ACR to easily manage their content to better support doctors and clients with any number of condition pages and resources. The project began with a development team of five and gradually streamlined until I took over as the sole developer interacting with the client.",
